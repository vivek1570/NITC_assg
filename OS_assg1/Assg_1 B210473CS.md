## Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to obtain and compile the most recent stable Linux kernel version available from the official kernel.org website. Subsequently, we aim to establish a dual-boot configuration on your Linux-based system, integrating the freshly compiled kernel alongside your existing Linux installation. The ultimate goal is to make both the current and new Linux kernel versions accessible and selectable via the GRUB bootloader menu during system startup.

## Methodology:

1. Download the Latest Stable Linux Kernel
2. Install Required Dependencies
3. Extract and Configure the Kernel
4. Compile the Kernel
5. Install Modules and kernel
6. Update GRUB
7. Reboot

### 1.Download the Latest Stable Linux Kernel
Visit the official Linux Kernel website at [https://www.kernel.org/](https://www.kernel.org/) to download the latest stable kernel source code. Identify the version you want to install, and note its version number.

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

Before we can compile the Linux kernel, we will need to ensure that your system has all the necessary tools, libraries, and header files. These dependencies are crucial for a successful compilation process. Below is a breakdown of what each component is and why it's essential:



```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses-dev bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev
```

### 3.Extract and Configure the Kernel

Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the kernel source code and extract it. Then, configure the kernel.Replace `6.5.1` with the actual version number you downloaded.

- Navigate to the Kernel Source Directory
- Extract the Kernel Source
- Configure the Kernel
- Save Configuration and Exit

```
tar -xvf linux-6.5.1.tar.gz
```

![[Pasted image 20230908090910.png]]

```
cd linux-6.5.1
make menuconfig
```

This command launches a text-based menu-driven configuration interface. Here's a basic overview of some key configuration sections:

- **General Setup**: Configure fundamental settings such as the kernel version, local version information, and kernel compression method.
- **Processor type and features**: Customize CPU-related options, including processor family, CPU frequency scaling, and virtualization support.
- **Device Drivers**: Enable or disable support for various hardware devices and drivers, including storage devices, network adapters, and USB devices.
- **File systems**: Configure support for different file system types (e.g., ext4, XFS, Btrfs) and file system features.
- **Networking support**: Enable or disable networking options, including protocols and network device drivers.
- **Security options**: Set security-related options such as SELinux or AppArmor.
- **Kernel hacking**: Configure options for debugging and kernel tracing.

```
After configuring the kernel to your specifications, save your changes and exit the configuration interface. Your settings will be saved in a `.config` file in the kernel source directory.
```



### 4.Compile the Kernel

After you have configured the Linux kernel source code to match your system's requirements, the next step is to compile the kernel. Compiling the kernel involves translating the human-readable C source code into machine-executable binary code that your computer can understand and use as the operating system.

- when you run the `make -j$(nproc)` command, it initiates the compilation process with the optimal number of simultaneous compilation tasks based on your CPU's core count
- After compiling the kernel successfully, the next steps typically involve installing the kernel modules and the kernel image, as well as updating the GRUB bootloader configuration to include the newly compiled kernel, as explained in previous responses.

This command will compile the kernel using the number of processor cores you have for parallel compilation, which speeds up the process.

### 5.Install Modules and Kernel

After successfully compiling the Linux kernel, you need to install the kernel modules and the kernel image onto your system. These are essential components for the proper functioning of the new kernel.

```

sudo make modules_install
sudo make install


```

### 6.Update GRUB

Update the GRUB configuration to include the new kernel:

```

sudo update-grub

```

### 7.Reboot

Reboot your system. When you see the GRUB menu during boot, you should now have the option to boot into the new kernel alongside your existing one.

1. **Save Your Work:** Ensure that you have saved any unsaved work and closed all running applications. Rebooting will restart your computer, and any unsaved changes may be lost.
    
2. **Issue the Reboot Command:** Open a terminal if you don't already have one open and enter the following command to initiate the reboot:
    
    
    `sudo reboot`
    
    This command will prompt you for your password because it requires administrative privileges to reboot the system.
    
3. **GRUB Boot Menu:** During the boot process, your computer will display the GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) menu. The GRUB menu typically appears shortly after your system's BIOS/UEFI screen and lists the available boot options.
    
4. **Select the Kernel:** In the GRUB menu, you should now see multiple boot options. This includes your existing Linux kernel version and the newly compiled one. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to highlight the desired kernel version, and then press Enter to boot into that kernel.
    
    - **Existing Kernel:** This option represents your current, stable Linux kernel, which you were using before the kernel compilation process.
        
    - **Newly Compiled Kernel:** This option represents the kernel you just compiled and installed.
        
5. **Boot into the Chosen Kernel:** After selecting the kernel version, your computer will proceed to boot into the selected kernel. You will see the familiar Linux boot sequence messages as the system initializes.
    
6. **Login and Verify:** Once the boot process is complete, log in to your system as usual. Now, you are running the kernel you selected from the GRUB menu. To verify that you are using the new kernel, you can open a terminal and use the following command:
